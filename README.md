# Yuus-Catastic-CIT

Github continously clowns on me.
<br>This is the official download! Please only download it from here, I can't guarantee any other sites.
<br>**When you download from github, you will have to unzip the folder, go into it, and then take out the actual CIT pack, you will know cus it doesn't have any dashes in its name.**

## RULES
- Do not redistribute this pack or its contents (models, files, or otherwise), **just link this repo if you want to share** (use [this](https://github.com/Daeyangae/Yuus-Catastic-CIT))
- Please link to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/daeyangae)/[tumblr](https://daeyangae.tumblr.com/) if the pack is used in the screenshot. Do not be afraid to ping me in this case by mentioning me or otherwise, I don't mind, ping me all day long.
- This pack was tested using [Mizunos 16 pack](https://mizunomcmemo.blogspot.com/), you don't HAVE to use it, but I highly recommend it.
- If there are any bugs/questions, please contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/daeyangae)/[tumblr](https://daeyangae.tumblr.com/), I will be more likely to check my twitter more often. (If you know me on discord, you are also free to DM me! I don't mind)
- If you have a github account, you can also put it here lol, although I cannot guarantee how speedy I will be.
- I can't think of a lot, but please do not make profit off of the models in this pack. If its a video or something I don't care just link the pack but do not sell the models specifically. :,) ty

Now onto the fun stuff!
